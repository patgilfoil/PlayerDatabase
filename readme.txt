To start the program, double click the executable named PlayerDatabase.exe. A window will pop up to greet you and show you options from a menu to choose from.
Selecting an option simply involves entering the number associated with the option and pressing Enter.
The first option, shows you all the scores currently saved. Nothing will show if there are no currently saved scores.
The second option, allows you to create a new player profile with a name and score, just enter the associated name and score you want to set and press enter.
The third option, will ask you to search for a specific profile by name. You can type a name and press enter to search for it. 
If it finds a profile with the associated name, the program will ask you to enter a new score for the profile, you can then simply type a new score and press enter and the score should be updated. 
If a profile is not found under the search terms, it will take you back to the main menu.
The fourth option, will load any scores on the save file if it has been modified in any way.
To close the program, just select the fifth option from the main menu.
